// time depends on the programming language
// cpp is bit faster than the java

// time also depends on the device 
// as well as on the input

// number of instructions performed by the programmer for giving the output

// example finding the sum of n numbers
// 1. using formula
// 2. using loop


// time complexity is the measure of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of input increases

// n^0 O(1) constant time complexity doesnt depend on n ie input
// O(n) linear time complexity depends on n ie input
// in case of sun of n numbers
// time complexity in using formula is constant
// time complexity in using loop is linear
